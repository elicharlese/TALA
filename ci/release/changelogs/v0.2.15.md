#### Improvements üßπ

- Padding reduced on containers to align with more compact look and feel of D2 0.2.
- `sql_table` routing switched from using hierarchical layout engine to orthogonal.
- Diagrams with multiple subgraphs are more compact.
- Much improved hierarchical alignments for diagrams where connections skip hierarchy levels (e.g. a node in the first row connected to another 2 rows down).

#### Bugfixes ‚õëÔ∏è

- Fixes an issue with hierarchy leveling where connections between two nodes of the same level could occur.
- `sql_table` connections where column is not specified no longer always points to first column.
