#### Improvements ðŸ§¹

- Route between table columns, instead of just tables, to show the exact relationship in Entity Relationship (ER) diagrams
- Improved consistency in the automatic direction of layouts
- `make install` defaults to installation to `/usr/local` as before but now if `/usr/local` is not accessible to the current user, it will use `~/.local` instead of prompting for sudo. You can pass `--prefix /usr/local` to force installation into `/usr/local` with a prompt for sudo.
