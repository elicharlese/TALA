TALA 0.3.0 implements position-locking to give control over parts of the diagram where you need it. This is an advanced feature that opens up a world of possibilities to create small bubbles of customized layouts and combine it with autolayout. For example, here's a legend:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terrastruct/TALA/master/docs/assets/legend.png" />

```d2
Legend: {
  top: 0
  left: 0
  blue: "" {
    width: 20
    height: 20
    left: 0
    top: 0
    style.stroke: black
  }
  blue-explanation: Actions {
    shape: text
    left: 50
    top: 0
  }

  green: "" {
    width: 20
    height: 20
    left: 0
    top: 50
    style.fill: honeydew
    style.stroke: black
  }
  green-explanation: Intermediate artifacts {
    shape: text
    left: 50
    top: 50
  }
}
```

We're excited to see all the creative diagrams this enables!

#### Features üöÄ

- `top` and `left` positions implemented.

#### Improvements üßπ

- ~30% faster for large, connected diagrams
- Much faster gap normalization for all diagrams
- Bin-packing algorithm improved to reduce whitespace between non-connected subgraphs

#### Bugfixes ‚õëÔ∏è

- Fixes label placements avoiding connections that weren't actually obstructing
- Fixes a rare panic that could with cluster nodes
- Edges could sometimes route through nodes that were not part of its subgraph
- Edges between containers that were perfectly aligned was sometimes unable to find a route.
