This release brings massive improvements in performance. Screenshot from our internal benchmarks on a batch of tests, comparing this release vs the last:

As a result of this, TALA by default now executes 3 runs in parallel with different seeds, and picking the best one for you. This should produce better results at a much higher rate!


#### Features üöÄ

- You can now pass in multiple seeds, and TALA will race multiple layout runs with
  different seeds, choosing the best outcome. See the TALA Manual for more.

#### Improvements üßπ

- Improves subgraph compaction giving space for better edges
- Improved edge routing for clustered nodes
- Significantly speeds up edge routing with many edges
- Significant performance improvements
- Uses up to 56% less memory for layouts with `sql_table`s

#### Bugfixes ‚õëÔ∏è

- Fixes a rare condition that allowed nodes with self loops to escape their containers
- Fixes edge from container going through descendants
- Fixes a bug that could cause some asymmetrical edge routing
- Fixes container shapes sometimes not having enough padding to fit icons
- Fixes the alignment of nodes connected to sequence steps
- Fixes the placement of clustered nodes connected to sequences

#### Breaking Changes

- `tala-seed` changed to `tala-seeds`. You can still continue to pass in a single number,
  same as before. But the name change is reflective that it can now take in multiple
  seeds.
