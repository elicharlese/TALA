#### Improvements 🧹

- Node placement is up to 2x faster
- Avoids overlapping edges when they have different arrowheads
- `direction` keyword now affects bidirectional edges
- Spacing between nodes ensures that labels will fit
- Edges stick to outer bounds of shapes with `3d` or `multiple`
- Improves layouts for clusters with both icons and labels
- Improves edge balancing to look more symmetrical

#### Bugfixes ⛑️

- Fixes shape and connection labels potentially overlapping arrowhead labels
- Fixes a bug with arrowhead labels on the `-` end of a connection
